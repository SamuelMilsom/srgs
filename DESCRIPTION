Title: Simulating Random Guess Scores
Version: 0.1.0

Description: This package provides tools in which to simulate
    scores from created tests and calculate probabilities. By
    defining individuals questions and compiling them into
    tests, this package uses appropriate simulation methods to
    create distributions of random guesses so as to avoid
    explicitly finding complicated distributions when doing so
    maybe unnecessary.
